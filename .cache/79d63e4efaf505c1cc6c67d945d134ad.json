Aren't we the good guys or what? :)\n<p>\n  Anyhow, for various reasons Johan became involved in a challenge to make low-res,\n  four color games. Thus Alex 4 was born. The Alex saga is a long one and\n  currently (as you probably can guess) in its fourth version. Read on!\n</p><p>\n\n</p><h3>DISTRIBUTING</h3>\n\n  Alex the Allegator 4 is freeware, anybody may (and should) play it.\n  Therefore, you are encouraged to distribute this game (in its original\n  form) like crazy. Upload to every website and bbs you know, give a copy to\n  all your friends, etc.. However, this game may not be included in a\n  compilation or any other kind of commercial package without the permission\n  from the author. See contact near the end of this document.\n\n\n<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>\n\n  Alex the Allegator 4 is a true jump'n'run, just like the old classic ones.\n  Guide Alex through the jungle in order to save his girlfriend\n  Lola from evil humans who want to make a bag of her.\n  <p>\n  Alex 4 is a very small game. It runs in a very low resolution with only four colors and will\n  not provide you with any real time video or 3D effects. Nor will it snare you with a compelling\n  storyline. It's only a short platform game with a few tricks up it's sleeve.\n  We're sure you'll like it.\n\n\n\n</p><h3>THE PLOT</h3>\n\n  As always everything was nice and quiet in the beginning. But suddenly... Oh no!\n  Lola is gone, again! This time she has been captured by evil humans who want\n  to turn her into a bag. Or a pair of expensive shoes.\n<p>\n  It's for real! Help Alex through the jungle so that he can save Lola. Hurry!\n\n<a name=\"play\"></a>\n</p><h3>PLAYING & CONTROLS</h3>\n\n  It's really easy. Every level has an exit which Alex must find in order to\n  advance to the next level. On his way, Alex can pick up various thing for\n  points and powerups.\n  <p>\n  Every here and there Alex will run into enemies. These can be jumped on and\n  eaten, or you can spit on them. Eating them will generate more points though.\n  </p><p>\n  To spit, you'll need ammo. This is obtained by eating large eggs that are\n  scattered over the levels. Watch your ammo level, once you're out of eggs you\n  must find new ones before you can spit again.\n</p><p>\n  Another way of defeating enemies is the roll mode. On some levels you can find\n  a rotating symbol. Step on it and Alex will turn into a ball and roll fast in\n  the direction he was facing.\n</p><p>\n  When rolling, Alex can crash into the enemies without losing health. He can\n  also crash into some blocks and make new paths through the level. While\n  rolling, it is impossible to stop or turn. Alex will not stop until he hits a\n  wall.\n\n\n</p><h4>Controls</h4>\nAlex the Allegator 4 is best played with a gamepad or joystick with at least two buttons.\nIf you still want to play it with the keyboard, here's how:\n<blockquote>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tr><td width=\"100\">move</td><td>left & right arrows</td></tr>\n<tr><td>jump</td><td>alt</td></tr>\n<tr><td>spit</td><td>left control (you can only spit if you have eggs!)</td></tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Overview</h4>\n\n  <img src=\"/a42703fec1d7933a49bd0aed2649486a.gif\" border=\"2\"><br>\n  <ol>\n  <li>This is <b>Alex</b>. You control him throughout the game.\n  </li><li>This is a typical <b>enemy</b>. Don't run into him or you'll lose energy. You can jump on some enemies to render them harmless.\n  </li><li>A <b>heart</b>. Pick it up to increase your energy. You can have at most two hearts at the same time.\n  </li><li><b>Bonus</b> items. Cherries and stars are scattered all over the level, eat them to increase your score.\n  </li><li>Here you can see how many <b>lives</b> you have left.\n  </li><li>Your current <b>energy</b> level. If you have no hearts left, you lose a life.\n  </li><li>Number of <b>eggs</b> you have. Pick up eggs to spit on enemies.\n  </li><li>Your current <b>score</b>.\n  </li><li><b>Ice</b> block and <b>roll</b> activator. Step on the roll activator to turn Alex into a ball, he can then smash the ice blocks.\n  </li></ol>\n\n\n<h3>PICKUPS</h3>\n\n  There are some items to be found in this game. Here's a short list of them:\n<blockquote>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tr><td width=\"100\">1up</td><td>gives you one extra life</td></tr>\n<tr><td>star</td><td>gives you 100 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>cherry</td><td>gives you 10 points</td></tr>\n<tr><td>heart</td><td>gives you more health (max two)</td></tr>\n<tr><td>egg</td><td>adds one egg to Alex' arsenal</td></tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<a name=\"ini\"></a>\n<h3>SETTINGS AND CUSTOMIZATION</h3>\n  In the root directory of Alex4 is a file named alex4.ini. This file holds most setting that you can change\n  to fine tune your gaming experience. By changing some values in this file you can select the game resolution,\n  sound and music volume, what mixer device to use and even more. Open the file in Notepad or a similar program,\n  all the options are explained within the file itself.\n<p>\n  If you don't want to bother with the .ini file you can make some quick changes at the menu screen.\n  By pressing 1, 2, 3 or 4 you can change they resolution of the game according to the table below.\n\n<blockquote>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<tr><td width=\"100\">1</td><td width=\"100\">160 x 120</td><td>windowed</td></tr>\n<tr><td width=\"100\">2</td><td>320 x 240</td><td>windowed</td></tr>\n<tr><td width=\"100\">3</td><td>640 x 480</td><td>windowed</td></tr>\n<tr><td width=\"100\">4</td><td>640 x 480</td><td>fullscreen</td></tr>\n</table>\n</blockquote>\n\n<a name=\"custom\"></a>\n</p><h3>CUSTOM GAME</h3>\n<h4>Play a custom game</h4>\nIn order to play a custom game you need to have a set of homemade\nlevels and a textfile describing where they are located on your computer.\nThe textfile should describe where the maps are located relative to the textfile itself. The textfile could look like this:\n\n<br>\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"2\"><tr><td>\n<font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">// mymaps.txt</font>\n</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=\"white\">\n<font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\" color=\"black\">\nHere's my first three maps! I hope you like them.<br>\n/ Johan<br>\n<br>\n#start#<br>\nlevel01.map<br>\nlevel02.map<br>\nlevel03.map<br>\n#end#<br>\n</font>\n</td></tr></table>\n<br>\n\nIn this case, the map files are located in the same directory as the textfile. If you want to have the textfile somewhere else,\nyou will need to add the relative path to the maps. Like this:\n\n<br>\n<table border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"2\"><tr><td>\n<font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">// mymaps.txt</font>\n</td></tr><tr><td bgcolor=\"white\">\n<font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\" color=\"black\">\nHere's my first three maps! I hope you like them.<br>\n/ Johan<br>\n<br>\n#start#<br>\nmaps/my_maps/level01.map<br>\nmaps/my_maps/level02.map<br>\nmaps/my_maps/level03.map<br>\n#end#<br>\n</font>\n</td></tr></table>\n<br>\n\nThe lines <font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">#start#</font> and <font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">#end#</font> are not optional, they must be there. In the rest of the file,\nyou can add whatever you want. Look in the <font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">custom_maps/</font> directory for an example.\n<br><br>\nNow in order to play the game, you only need to drag and drop the textfile on the game's icon. It couldn't be easier.\n\n<h4>Make a custom game</h4>\nIf you want to make some maps of your own, you need to enter the Editor. You can access it in two ways. 1) From the main menu by selecting the EDITOR choice. 2) By pressing F1 while playing a custom game.\n<br><br>\nThe maps in alex4 are made of tiles. Each tile can have a type or an enemy assigned to it. An item may also be placed on a tile.\nI suggest you take a look at the example maps (in <font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">custom_maps/</font>) to see how they work in practice.\n<br><br>\nHere's a crib sheet over the functions in the editor.\n<br><br>\n<table align=\"center\" border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" width=\"500\">\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#7890ab\"><b>File handling</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>load map</td><td>shift + L</td></tr>\n<tr><td>save map</td><td>shift + S</td></tr>\n<tr><td>quit editor</td><td>ESC (twice)</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#7890ab\"><b>Map handling</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>map properties</td><td>F1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>increase width</td><td>insert + left or right</td></tr>\n<tr><td>decrease width</td><td>delete + left or right</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#7890ab\"><b>Tiles</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>draw tile</td><td>left mouse button</td></tr>\n<tr><td>pick tile</td><td>right mouse button</td></tr>\n<tr><td>browse tiles</td><td>z/x</td></tr>\n<tr><td>tile palette</td><td>p</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#7890ab\"><b>Tile types</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>player dies</td><td>q</td></tr>\n<tr><td>level exit</td><td>w</td></tr>\n<tr><td>roll activator</td><td>e</td></tr>\n<tr><td>breakable block</td><td>r</td></tr>\n<tr><td>water</td><td>t</td></tr>\n<tr><td>water surface</td><td>y</td></tr>\n<tr><td>alex start, left</td><td>a</td></tr>\n<tr><td>alex start, right</td><td>shift + A</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#7890ab\"><b>Items</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>1 up</td><td>1</td></tr>\n<tr><td>star</td><td>2</td></tr>\n<tr><td>cherry</td><td>3</td></tr>\n<tr><td>egg</td><td>4</td></tr>\n<tr><td>heart</td><td>5</td></tr>\n\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\" bgcolor=\"#7890ab\"><b>Enemies</b></td></tr>\n<tr><td>grunt</td><td>shift + Q</td></tr>\n<tr><td>spear grunt</td><td>shift + W</td></tr>\n<tr><td>crusher</td><td>shift + E</td></tr>\n<tr><td>spike fish</td><td>shift + R</td></tr>\n<tr><td>jellyfish</td><td>shift + T</td></tr>\n<tr><td>cannon</td><td>shift + Y</td></tr>\n<tr><td>boss, spike truck</td><td>shift + U</td></tr>\n<tr><td>boss, ground pounder</td><td>shift + I</td></tr>\n</table>\n<br><br>\nTo remove tile types, enemies or items, you can either replace them with a different object, or you can place the same object again at the same position and it will disappear.\n<br><br>\n<b>Some hints:</b><br>\n<li>Note that tile types and enemies occupy the same memory slot on the tile so\nyou can only have one of them on the same tile.\n</li><li>The start position for Alex can face right or left depending if you press a or A.\n</li><li>Good maps concentrate on a certain trick or element, if you mix all elements\ninto a map it will be very hard to make it into a good map. Think themes.\n</li><li>Don't forget to save your maps before you quit the editor!\n\n<h4>Upload your maps</h4>\nIf you've made some maps that you think are good ones, don't hesitate to share them with your friends. If you also\nwant to share them with other Alex-players all over the world.\nVisit <a href=\"http://www.freelunchdesign.com\">Free Lunch Design</a> for uploading instructions.\n\n\n<a name=\"faq\"></a>\n<h3>TROUBLESHOOTING / FAQ</h3>\n<p>\n    <b>Q:</b> I have problems with a specific level, can I mail you and ask about it?\n\t<br>\n    <b>A:</b> No, you cannot. We get truckloads of mail. Please ask at the forum at <a href=\"http://www.freelunchdesign.com\">Free Lunch Design</a> instead. Someone will know\n       the answer.\n</p><p>\n    <b>Q:</b> The music stutters and plays strangely. What can I do about it?\n\t<br>\n    <b>A:</b> Depending on your computer's speed and hardware you may have to alter the sound settings in alex4.ini.\n\tRead more on how to do that <a href=\"#ini\">here</a>.\n</p><p>\n\t<b>Q:</b> Why is it called Alex 4? Are there any prequels?\n\t<br>\n    <b>A:</b> It is the fourth game about Alex the Allegator. Three more Alex games have been made in the past, they are available\n       at <a href=\"http://www.freelunchdesign.com\">Free Lunch Design</a>. Or at least linked from there.\n</p><p>\n    <b>Q:</b> Have you made any other free games?\n\t<br>\n    <b>A:</b> Yes indeed, take a look at our main site <a href=\"http://www.freelunchdesign.com\">Free Lunch Design</a>\n       You will find lots more there.\n</p><p>\n    <b>Q:</b> Why on earth did you waste your time on this game? Why didn't you make\n       it in high resolution and more colors?\n\t   <br>\n    <b>A:</b> There was a challenge at www.total-klik.com where the rules stated low\n       res and four colors. Also, it's entertaining and challenging to try to\n       push as much as possible into a small restricted space. Why do painters\n       paint when they can take photos?\n\n</p><p>\n<b>Q:</b> I have read this entire text at least twice and I still cannot find the answer to my problems.
